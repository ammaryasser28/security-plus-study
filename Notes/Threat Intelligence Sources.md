# Threat Research Sources

**Threat research** is a counterintelligence effort in which security companies and researchers attempt to discover the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of modern cyber adversaries.

---

## Key Points

- Many companies and academic institutions are engaged in **primary cybersecurity research**.  
- Security solution providers with **firewall and anti-malware platforms** derive data from their customers' networks.  
- While assisting customers with cybersecurity operations, these providers can **analyze and publicize TTPs and their indicators**.  
- These organizations often operate **honeynets** to observe how hackers interact with vulnerable systems.

## Primary Threat Intelligence Sources

### 🌑 Dark Web

- The **deep web** refers to parts of the web not indexed by search engines:  
  - Pages requiring registration  
  - Pages blocking search indexing  
  - Unlinked pages  
  - Pages using nonstandard DNS or encoding  
- Some areas are deliberately concealed from "regular" browser access.

### 🕸️ Dark Net

- A network overlay established by software such as:  
  - **The Onion Router (TOR)**  
  - **Freenet**  
  - **I2P**  
- Purpose: **anonymize usage** and prevent third parties from monitoring activity.  
- Example: **Onion routing** uses multiple layers of encryption and relays between nodes to maintain anonymity.

### 🔍 Dark Web vs Dark Net

- **Dark web**: Sites, content, and services accessible only over a dark net.  
- Many dark web sites are **hidden from search engines**, often accessible only via **word-of-mouth URLs or bulletin boards**.  
- Some dark web search engines exist, but many sites remain hidden.



# Threat Intelligence Providers

Threat intelligence platforms and feeds are supplied as one of **three different commercial models**:

---

## 1. Closed / Proprietary

- The threat research is available as a **paid subscription** to a commercial threat intelligence platform.  
- Security solution providers often make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers via:  
  - Blogs  
  - White papers  
  - Webinars  

**Examples of such platforms:**  
- [IBM X-Force Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com)  
- [FireEye Threat Intelligence](https://www.fireeye.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html)  
- [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/threat-intelligence-feeds)  

---

## 2. Vendor Websites

- Proprietary threat intelligence is **not always provided at cost**.  
- Security, hardware, and software vendors make a large amount of threat research available via their websites as a general benefit to customers.  

**Example:**  
- [Microsoft Security Intelligence Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-security-intelligence)  

---

## 3. Public / Private Information Sharing Centers

- Many critical industries have set up **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)** to share threat intelligence and promote best practices.  
- These are **sector-specific resources** for companies and agencies in industries like:  
  - Power supply  
  - Financial markets  
  - Aviation  
- If no ISAC exists for a sector, **local industry groups and associations** may provide mutual support.  

**Example:**  
- [National ISACs](https://nationalisacs.org/member-isacs)  

---

## 4. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

- Some companies operate threat intelligence services on an **open-source basis**, earning income from consultancy rather than directly from the platform or research effort.  

**Examples:**  
- [AT&T Security / AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com)  
- [Malware Information Sharing Project (MISP)](https://misp-project.org/feeds)  
- [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/organization)  
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)
