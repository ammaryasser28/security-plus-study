# Attack Vectors

An **Attack Vector** is the path that a threat actor uses to gain access to a secure system.  
In most cases, gaining access means being able to run malicious code on the target.

## Common Attack Vectors

### 💻 Direct Access
- A physical or local attack.  
- Examples: exploiting an unlocked workstation, using a boot disk to install malicious tools, or stealing a device.

### 💾 Removable Media
- Malware concealed on USB drives or memory cards.  
- The attacker tricks employees into connecting the media to a PC, laptop, or smartphone.  
- Some exploits run automatically; others require the employee to open a file or run a setup program.

### 📧 Email
- Malicious attachments sent via email or other systems that allow attachments.  
- Social engineering is used to persuade the user to open the attachment.

### 🌐 Remote and Wireless
- The attacker obtains credentials for remote access or wireless networks or cracks authentication protocols.  
- May spoof trusted resources (e.g., access points) to harvest credentials and access the network.

### 🖥️ Web and Social Media
- Malware may be attached to posts or offered as downloads.  
- Attackers may compromise websites to automatically infect vulnerable browsers (**drive-by downloads**).

### ☁️ Cloud
- Target cloud services where accounts, hosts, or weak credentials exist.  
- May attack cloud service providers (CSPs) to gain access to victim systems.  
- Focus often on accounts managing cloud services or development environments.
