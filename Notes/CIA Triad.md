# Information Security

**Information Security (Infosec)** is the protection of data from unauthorized access, attacks, theft, or damage.

Data can be vulnerable based on:  
- **How it is stored**  
- **How it is transferred**  
- **How it is processed**

## 🛡️ CIA Triad

Secure information is defined by three core principles:

### 🔐 Confidentiality  
Only authorized individuals should have access to the information (who Can Access).

### 🧩 Integrity  
Data must remain accurate and unchanged unless modified by authorized users (who Can Modify).

### 🟢 Availability  
Information must be accessible to authorized users whenever needed.
