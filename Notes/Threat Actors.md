# Attributes of Threat Actors

Understanding threat actors helps in assessing and mitigating security risks. They can be classified based on **access** and **intent/motivation**.

## 👥 Internal / External

- **External Threat Actor:**  
  - Has no account or authorized access to the target system.  
  - Must infiltrate the system using malware and/or social engineering.  
  - Can attack remotely or on-premises (e.g., breaking into a company's headquarters).  
  - The actor is defined as external, not the attack method.

- **Internal (Insider) Threat Actor:**  
  - Has been granted permissions on the system.  
  - Typically employees, but can also include contractors or business partners.

## 🎯 Intent / Motivation

- **Intent:** What the attacker hopes to achieve from the attack.  
- **Motivation:** The reason behind perpetrating the attack.  

**Examples:**  
- Motivated by greed, curiosity, or grievances  
- Intent could be to vandalize/disrupt a system or steal information  

- **Unintentional Threat Actors:**  
  - Represent accidents, oversights, and other mistakes  
  - Different from malicious actors with deliberate intent

## 🖥️ Hackers

- **Hacker:** An individual with the skills to gain access to computer systems through unauthorized or unapproved means.  
- Originally, "hacker" was a neutral term for someone skilled in programming and system administration.  
- Hacking was seen as a sign of technical skill and creativity.  
- **Black Hat:** Unauthorized hacking  
- **White Hat:** Authorized hacking (penetration testing)

### ⚖️ Gray Hat Hackers
- Semi-authorized: may find vulnerabilities without owner approval.  
- Typically does not exploit vulnerabilities maliciously.  
- May seek voluntary compensation (bug bounties) but avoids extortion.  
- White hat hackers always obtain authorization before testing systems.

## 👶 Script Kiddies

- Someone who uses hacker tools without fully understanding them.  
- Attacks often have no specific target or goal other than attention or proving skills.

## 🤝 Hacker Teams and Hacktivists

- Historically, hackers were lone actors with limited resources.  
- Modern threat actors often work in teams, developing sophisticated tools and strategies.  
- **Hacktivist groups** (e.g., Anonymous, WikiLeaks, LulzSec) use cyber attacks to promote political agendas.  
- Activities may include:  
  - Releasing confidential information publicly  
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks  
  - Website defacements
