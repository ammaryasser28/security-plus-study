# Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk

As part of security assessment and monitoring, security teams must identify ways in which their systems could be attacked.

These assessments involve three main concepts:  
- **Vulnerabilities**  
- **Threats**  
- **Risk**

As part of security assessment and monitoring, security teams must identify ways in which their systems could be attacked.  
These assessments involve three main concepts: **Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk**.

## 🛠️ Vulnerability
A **vulnerability** is a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.  

**Examples of vulnerabilities include:**  
- Improperly configured or installed hardware or software  
- Delays in applying and testing software and firmware patches  
- Untested software and firmware patches  
- Misuse of software or communication protocols  
- Poorly designed network architecture  
- Insecure password usage

## ⚠️ Threat
A **threat** is the potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security.  

- A threat may be **intentional** or **unintentional**  
- The person or thing that poses the threat is called a **threat actor** or **threat agent**  
- The path or tool used by a malicious threat actor is called an **attack vector**

## 📊 Risk
**Risk** is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.  

To assess risk:  
1. Identify a vulnerability  
2. Evaluate the likelihood of it being exploited by a threat  
3. Assess the impact that a successful exploit would have
